# SPFx-Image-Mapper
SharePoint SPFx  Web part for mapping an image with clickable sections.

SPFx Version: 1.14 
Framework: React

How it works:
* Add an image URL.
* Add Image mapping areas, and url

user clicks on the areas and is directed to url.

App uses <SVG> to create clickable sections.

hint: I use https://boxy-svg.com/app to determine the SVG paths
